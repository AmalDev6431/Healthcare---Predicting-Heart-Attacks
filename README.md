# Healthcare---Predicting-Heart-Attacks

Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. This project aims to identify the factors impacting cardiovascular health and build a predictive model to detect heart attacks effectively. The dataset contains information about various variables related to heart health, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The goal is to analyze this data and develop a system that can accurately predict the risk of heart attacks based on individual health attributes.

Data Analysis and Preprocessing

1.	Preliminary Data Inspection:
* Perform a thorough examination of the dataset's structure, check for missing values, duplicates, and handle any inconsistencies.

3.	Data Exploration:
*	Obtain a statistical summary to understand the central tendencies and spread of the data.
*	Explore categorical variables using count plots to gain insights into their distributions.
4.	Study Relationships:
* Analyze the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) across different age categories.
* Examine the composition of patients based on gender.
* Investigate the relationship between resting blood pressure (trestbps) and the risk of heart attacks.
* Describe the association between cholesterol levels and the target variable (heart attack).
5.	Feature Analysis:
*	Understand the relationship between peak exercise and the occurrence of heart attacks.
*	Evaluate the impact of thalassemia on cardiovascular disease.
*	Identify other factors that significantly influence the risk of heart attacks.
6.	Data Visualization:
*	Utilize a pair plot to visualize the relationships between all variables.
Building Baseline Models
1.	Logistic Regression and Random Forest:
*	Build baseline models using logistic regression and random forest algorithms to predict heart attack risk.
*	Perform correlation analysis and logistic regression for feature selection using standard error and p-values from statsmodels.
  
Conclusion

This project aims to gain valuable insights into the factors contributing to cardiovascular diseases and develop a predictive model to detect heart attacks.
